# Programming Language Theory

**Programming Language Theory** Focuses on the design, implementation, analysis, and understanding of programming languages. The distinctions between **syntax**, **semantics**, and **pragmatics** are fundamental in language, computer science:
- **Syntax**: Defines the formal grammar for constructing valid programs.
- **Semantics**: Explains the behavior of programs (e.g., operational, denotational, axiomatic semantics).
- **Pragmatics**: Examines practical use, style, and conventions in programming.

## 1. **Syntax**
- **Definition**: Syntax refers to the formal structure or rules that govern how elements are combined to form valid expressions or sentences.
- **Focus**: The **form** of expressions, without regard to their meaning.
- **Example**:
  - In natural language: A syntactically correct English sentence is *"The cat sleeps."*
  - In programming: A syntactically correct Python statement is `if x > 0:`.

## 2. **Semantics**
- **Definition**: Semantics deals with the **meaning** or interpretation of expressions within a given system.
- **Focus**: The **content** or what is being conveyed.
- **Example**:
  - In natural language: *"The cat sleeps"* means there is a specific cat that is performing the action of sleeping.
  - In programming: `if x > 0:` implies a conditional check to determine if `x` is greater than zero.

## 3. **Pragmatics**
- **Definition**: Pragmatics focuses on the **contextual use** of expressions, including how meaning changes based on usage or situational factors.
- **Focus**: The **practical application** of expressions and how interpretation is influenced by context.
- **Example**:
  - In natural language: *"Can you open the window?"* is a syntactically and semantically valid question but pragmatically is often understood as a request.
  - In programming: A variable named `temp` might pragmatically suggest it stores a temporary value, even though syntactically it could hold any value.

## Summary Table

| **Aspect**    | **Definition**                      | **Focus**          | **Example (Language)**                 | **Example (Programming)**    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Syntax**     | Rules governing structure          | Form               | *"I sleeps the cat"* (wrong syntax)   | `if x > 0` (correct form)     |
| **Semantics**  | Meaning of expressions             | Content            | *"The sky is green"* (wrong meaning)  | `if x > 0:` (checks x's value)|
| **Pragmatics** | Contextual use and interpretation  | Usage in context   | *"It's cold here"* (implied request)  | Naming conventions, e.g., `temp` |
